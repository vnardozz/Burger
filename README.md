# Burger


Visit my project on Heroku  at https://lit-wildwood-52667.herokuapp.com/


this is a full stack app that makes use of handlebars to handle html and css and uses a orm file for handling the MySQL commands.


users are able to start the app where they will be directed to the home page route. This displays burgers that have already been added to the database when intially ran.

there is a text field which allows users to add new "burgers" to be devoured and creates unique ID's for queries to target and manipulate the entry.

once a burger has been created the user can then "devour it" which will make use of the eat burger query to update the database based on the id of that entry and then return a statement that " you ate: (whatever burger had been selected)"


this app is helpful in making use of server side rendering to allow a different form of functionality to display to the browser. Also the use of mySQL queries lets the user add and maniplute data in an effective way.
